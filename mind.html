                        Vitamin D is absorbed by our skin which has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. Also, vitamin D is needed for our bodies to be able to absorb calcium which is needed for our bone health.
                        Boosts moods - Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a depressive disorder which has seasonal patterns. 
                        Being exposed to natural light can help regulate your sleep cycle for more well rested days.</p>

        <h2>The importance of sleep</h2>
        <p>Not only do we need enough sleep (around 7-9 hours a night if you’re an adult) but we need good quality sleep. Sleep is essential as it allows our minds and bodies to recharge and it allows our brain to function properly.
        Our sleep cycle is regulated by a 24 hour cycle called the circadian rhythm. Light has an effect on this, in the evening when the natural light disappears, our body release hormones that make us drowsy. The opposite occurs when the sun rises, our body releases hormones that make us feel more alert.
        <h3>There are small ways in which we can improve our habits to get a better quality sleep:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Having a realistic time to be in bed for all days of the week.</li>
            <li>Have light blocking curtains or an eye mask.</li>
            <li>Not looking at screens at least 30 minutes before your bedtime.</li>
            <li>Not having caffeine 6 hours before your bedtime.</li>
            <li>Exercise during the day to help unwind in the evening and tire your body for sleep</li>
            </ul>
