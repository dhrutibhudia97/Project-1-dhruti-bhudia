        <h2>Immersing ourselves in nature</h2>
        <p>
            Unsurprisingly immersing ourselves in nature has a positive impact on our health. But don't panic if you live in an apartment block in the city, because the amount of time to be spending in these green spaces to benefit is only <b>2 HOURS A WEEK!</b> This can be split into smaller chunks across the week. 
                Nature has been proven to be an antidote for stress: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing anxiety</li>
                    <li>Lowering blood pressure</li>
                    <li>Lowering  stress causing hormone levels</li>
                    <li>Improves immune system</li> 
                    <li>Promoting calmness and a mood lifter</li>

        <h2>The importance of getting natural light</h2>
        <p>
        Vitamin D is absorbed by our skin which has been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. Also, vitamin D is needed for our bodies to be able to absorb calcium which is needed for our bone health.
        Boosts moods - Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a depressive disorder which has seasonal patterns. 
        Being exposed to natural light can help regulate your sleep cycle for more well rested days.</p>

            <h3>There are easy ways you can get more light into your life:</h3>
                <ul>    
                <li>Ditch the curtains.</li>
                <li>Mirrors to a room to reflect sunlight around a room.</li>
                <li>Lighter coloured walls reflect more light</li>
                <li>working or exercising near a window</li>   
                </ul>    

        <p>If this isn’t possible, purchasing a SAD lamp- which are extra bright lamps that mimic the sunlight, useful for winter seasons when there isn’t much natural light during the day.

        <h2>The importance of sleep</h2>
        <p>Not only do we need enough sleep (around 7-9 hours a night if you’re an adult) but we need good quality sleep. Sleep is essential as it allows our minds and bodies to recharge and it allows our brain to function properly.
        Our sleep cycle is regulated by a 24 hour cycle called the circadian rhythm. Light has an effect on this, in the evening when the natural light disappears, our body release hormones that make us drowsy. The opposite occurs when the sun rises, our body releases hormones that make us feel more alert.
        <h3>There are small ways in which we can improve our habits to get a better quality sleep:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Having a realistic time to be in bed for all days of the week.</li>
            <li>Have light blocking curtains or an eye mask.</li>
            <li>Not looking at screens at least 30 minutes before your bedtime.</li>
            <li>Not having caffeine 6 hours before your bedtime.</li>
            <li>Exercise during the day to help unwind in the evening and tire your body for sleep</li>
            </ul>
