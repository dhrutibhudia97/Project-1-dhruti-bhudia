## Testing

- All of the features in this project work as intended. Clicking the logo takes you back to the home page. Clicking on each option on the menu takes you to the intended pages. Clicking the social media icons on the footer also takes you to the home pages of these different social media websites. 

- The videos on the mind and body page work and users have control over playing the video. If the video doesn't load, they will be able to click the URL to watch the video.

- The hero images with the zoom-in effect on the home and mind page work as intended, and there is no animation of the hero image for screens smaller than 480px to help with formatting and to not overcrowd the screen.

- All of the features discussed above also work on different screen sizes: desktops (1024px), tablets (768px), and smartphones (480px and lower). The images and text also change size to support the screens viewport.

### Validator Testing
- HTML
  No errors found when using HTML validator - "https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fdhrutibhudia97.github.io%2FProject-1-dhruti-bhudia%2F"

### Unfixed bugs 
- When using aria-labels to provide alternative text to hero images, it removed the cover-text box, so I chose the cover-text-box over aria labels as it provides information related to the image if the hero image doesn't load.
 
- When I centered the footer using ".social-networks > li {display:inline-block;}" and got rid of the padding and margins, this would get inherited and ruin the text and image layout, so I have chosen to decrease the font size in the footer with the screen size.

- On screens smaller than 768px, images are not aligned to centre of the screen. Auto margin-left and margin-right did not centre the images to the text in the same section.
