This site is for people who want to make changes in their daily life to feel healthier physically and mentally. It provides them with information, advice and video tutorials to be able to start making small changes from the comfort of their home.

This website helps them learn more about the aspects involved in healthy well-being, good quality sleep and how to start implementing this into their daily routine.

## Testing

All of the features in this project work as intended. Clicking the logo takes you back to the home page. Clicking on each option on the menu takes you to the intended pages. Clicking the social media icons on the footer also takes you the home pages of these different social media websites. 

The videos on the mind and body page work and users have control over playing the video. 

The hero images with the zoom in effect on the home and mind page work as intended.

All of the features discussed above also work on different screen sizes: desktop, tablets and smart phones. The images and text also change size to support the screen size.

### Unfixed bugs
- Footer content not centered.
- Don't know how to leave text/url alternative to images or videos if they dont load.
- media queries for the screen sizes between standard screen sizes (e.g. large ipads or small phones) text and pictures dont take up space efficiently, scroll bar may be in place.) Can add another media query for that...
